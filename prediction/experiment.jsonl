{"question": "LRRK2 (dardarin) Mutations in the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 gene (LRRK2 or Dardarin) are considered to be a common cause of autosomal dominant and sporadic ParkinsonÂ´s disease, but the prevalence of these mutations varies among populations. The leucine rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2/dardarin) is implicated in autosomal dominant familial and sporadic Parkinson's disease (PD); Mutations in LRRK2 (leucine-rich repeat kinase 2) (also known as PARK8 or dardarin) are responsible for the autosomal-dominant form of PD (Parkinson's disease).  Pathogenic mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2; PARK8) encoding dardarin, implicated in patients with autosomal dominant and sporadic Parkinson's disease (PD)  Missense mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2)/Dardarin gene, the product of which encodes a kinase with multiple domains, are known to cause autosomal dominant late onset Parkinson's disease (PD)." }
{"question": "single-pot solid-phase-enhanced sample preparation (SP3) Exploiting SP3, a novel technology for proteomic sample preparation using magnetic beads, we scaled down proteome analysis to single cells.  here we introduce a novel protocol using paramagnetic beads, termed Single-Pot Solid-Phase-enhanced Sample Preparation (SP3). SP3 provides a rapid and unbiased means of proteomic sample preparation in a single tube that facilitates ultrasensitive analysis by outperforming existing protocols in terms of efficiency, scalability, speed, throughput, and flexibility." }
